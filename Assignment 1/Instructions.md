# Informatics 1: Cognitive Science

## Assignment 1: Perceptrons and the Past Tense Debate

### Good Scholarly Practice

Please remember the University requirements regarding all assessed work for credit. Details about this can be found at: http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/admin/policies/academic-misconduct. This document is short; please read it carefully.

This assignment is to be completed individually, and you are required to take reasonable measures to protect your assessed work from unauthorised access. For example, if you put any such work on a public repository then you must set access permissions appropriately (generally permitting access only to yourself, or your group in the case of group practicals).


### Answering questions

The assignment notebooks include a combination of instructions, code that has been written for you to use, run, or examine, and questions you need to answer.


#### Code
In every place where you need to write code you will see:

```# YOUR CODE HERE
raise NotImplementedError()```

or 

```# YOUR CODE HERE
```

Delete the `raise NotImplementedError()` (if applicable) and write your solution code inside the marked cell. 


#### Text
For questions that require you to write text the cell will say `YOUR ANSWER HERE`. Again delete that line if you want to answer the question and write your response in the marked cell.

Most of the cells that already contained text or calculations will be read-only. You can open new cells for additional calculation or notes, however __these cells will not be part of your submission__ and will not be considered for marking! Thus, make sure that all your solutions are contained in the marked cells.


### Submission information 

Before you submit the assignment, please validate your notebooks. Then submit both notebooks on Notable by clicking on the "submit" button for each. You can submit as often as you like, the most recent submission received before the deadline will count.

Note that we may keep the submission system open after the deadline; this is to allow students who have an extension to submit. If you submit late without an extension, you will receive a penalty. For details, see http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/student-services/ito/admin/coursework-projects/late-coursework-extension-requests.

The deadline for this assignment is 04/03/2022 17:00 GMT.


### More Information and Documentation

If you need help with this assignment please ask the demonstrator in your lab in the first instance. You are also welcome to post queries on Piazza.
